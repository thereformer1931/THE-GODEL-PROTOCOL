THE GÖDEL PROTOCOL
The only security system in mathematics is a vault, inside a vault, inside a vault.

The first block lacks validation and certification of its existence, more importantly, 
no security system has been established, this is paramount.

We establish the agreement of at least three independent human agents for the legitimacy 
of the first block, and strategic security checkpoints throughout the eight master chains, 
of our four dimensional LÖCKLEDGER and must be established such that:

𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ+0𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ-0𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲* ⟦[{(𝚽έ0pwq*)}]⟧ = 000
𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ+1𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ-1𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲* ⟦[{(𝚽έ0pwq*)}]⟧ = 000
𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ-2𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ+2𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲* ⟦[{(𝚽έ0pwq*)}]⟧ = 000

The positive independent human-agent supervisor 𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{(𝚮𝚲έ+0pwq*)}]⟧ compares non-contaminated result 
𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{(𝚮𝚲έ-0pwq*)}]⟧ against the negative independent human agent supervisor non-contaminated result.

If no two human agents result is different than zero (0) for the creation, validation and certification 
of the first hypercube then comes into existence, promoting LÖCKLEDGER into existence.
